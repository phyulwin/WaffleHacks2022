# Project Description
## Inspiration

As we are all students, we wanted to make a website that would benefit others like us! We wanted to create a platform that would connect like-minded peers and students to discuss and study together. We found inspiration from the study website Tiffany found (Lifeat.io), Tina Huang (a data scientist at a FAANG company) which hosts daily live study sessions, and study-along Youtube videos.  These cumulatively increasing in popularity recently demonstrates that people are searching for a way to be held accountable by studying alongside real people and we want to foster that.

## What it does
In CampStudy, the campfire aesthetic alongside the Lofi music provides a warm and cozy environment to chat and study alongside other peers. Students are assigned to rooms based on the subject they plan to study, this ensures that all students have a safe place to ask questions while they study and learn from each other.

## How we built it
We used HTML and CSS for the front-end, and for the back-end, we used flask framework for python alongside SocketIO for the chat feature.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble formatting certain items/ buttons in CSS. We also had trouble implementing auth0 to python code, and trying to connect and redirect URLs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of completing a project in 48 hours, especially with all of us being in different time zones! We persisted through many challenges and issues to bring our vision of the website to life and that's something we are really proud of.

## What we learned
We learned to distribute responsibilities among teammates based on each of our strengths, as well as how to adapt to new tools and techs. 

## What's next for CampStudy
Some features we plan on adding: -Voice functionality -Allowing users to pick their own music (link Spotify, Youtube, Itunes) -image uploading through chat
